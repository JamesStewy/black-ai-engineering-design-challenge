# <span>black.ai</span> Engineering Design Challenge

The STEP file in this repo contains my submission for [black.ai's engineering design challenge](https://github.com/black-ai/engineering-design-challenge).

My case is designed to be 3D printed with a light weight plastic in two halves with the top part of the case printed upside down.

## Assembly

1. Attach the regulator to the bottom half of the case using M3 nuts and bolts.
   The bolts are inserted from the bottom of the bottom half of the case and nuts are placed on the top side of the regulator.
2. Insert input and output wires to the regulator, laying the cable slack in the slots which are located at the top of both ends of the bottom section.
3. Attach top half of the case by pushing it into the bottom case from the top.

## Assumptions

- The case will not have to be opened very frequently.
- The case won't experience heavy loads. The case only has to hold itself and the regulator together.

## Design Features

The main design feature of this case is the snap locks used to hold the top and bottom halves of the case together.
I chose this design over using more bolts because it is simpler to assemble (just push the parts together rather than inserting 4 more bolts) and it is more visually appealing when being wall mounted.

This case design features 4 tabs at either end of the case with M3 bolt holes for mounting.
I chose to use bolts for mounting to allow the case to be mounted in a variety of different situations.
Depending on the mounting situation, these could be replaced with alternate mounting solutions such as clips.

Finally the design has long slots on the sides to allow the regulator to be passively cooled.
